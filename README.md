## Why?

Kibana comes package with its own plugin installer, so why shoehorn plugins? The answer can be found simply by looking at the installation instructions on just about *every* third party Kibana plugin out there. All of them generally ask you to download the plugin from github, or some other repo source, and copy it into the plugins path. Since Kibana expects a plugin's version (or `kibana.version`) to match Kibana's version down to the patch release, many also ask the user to modify the `package.json` file to match your version of Kibana.

Kibana's plugin installer requires authors to publish a zip file somewhere for the installer to download and unpack. There's a reason for this, related to build assets, but most plugins don't need this, so it's just extra overhead for authors. And as you can see from their installation steps, they don't bother with this step.

That's a lot of manual steps just to author and to use a plugin. We can do better.

`kbn-shoehorn` handles all the steps you usually have to do manually, so you can get plugins installed and ready to run with 1 command.

## Installing from repo

`kbn-shoehorn` can use a git repo's username/repo path. It will download the plugin directly from the repo and place it in the Kibana plugins path. See the [download-git-repo](https://github.com/flipxfx/download-git-repo#examples) docs for options other than github.

## Versioning

`kbn-shoehorn` doesn't enforce anything. Instead, it will re-write the `version` (or `kibana.version`) in the `package.json` so it matches Kibana's version. This may not be safe, as the author of the plugin may not have meant for the plugin to work with the version of Kibana you are running. But it's your Kibana, that's for *you* to decide.

## Speed

When you install a plugin using Kibana's built in installer, it will run the optimization step every time. This can be really time consuming when you are trying to install several plugins at once. `kbn-shoehorn` just copies the plugin and leaves that step for when you start Kibana.
